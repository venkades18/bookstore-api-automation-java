| 🔄 **Framework**        | Rest Assured+ Cucumber BDD – For readable, behavior-driven API automation 
| 🛠 **Build Tool**       | Maven – For dependency management & CI/CD integrations 
| ✅ **Test Execution**   | TestNG Chosen for test execution, parallel runs, retries & CI/CD integration

--------------------
## 🧪 Why This Stack?

### ✅ TestNG over JUnit
- Better suited for **non-Spring Boot** projects.
- Robust test orchestration: **retry mechanisms**, **parallel execution**, **custom listeners**.
- Seamless CI/CD compatibility.

------------------------------
**How to Set Up & Run the Project**

 **Prerequisites**
 
1) Java 11+
2)  Maven

 1) Create a new maven project for automation or clone from the github if already present
 2) Fork the Dev repo given and make it up in the local machine , to run the automation (The steps will be present in README.md of Dev repo)
 3) End Points automated covered in this automation are:
   
     * POST /signup – To sign up to the book store
     * POST /login – To login after sign up and generate a token
     * POST /books – Create a new book
     * PUT /books/{id} – Update an existing book
     * GET /books/{id} – Fetch a book by ID
     * GET /books – Fetch all books
     * DELETE /books/{id} – Delete a book

6) Execute the automation suite by running the Cucumber Runner. This will trigger all feature scenarios written in a human-readable format, ensuring comprehensive test coverage and clear visibility into the executed test cases.
7) Once done , Allure- reports will be generate and can be seen under target/allure-results

# **🚀 CI/CD Integration**

## **✅ Prerequisites:**    

   Install Jenkins and necessary plugins - Git ,Github,Pipeline , Maven and Allure plugins ( these plugins can be installed via Jenkins UI )
   
   Ngrok (for development purpose)

## **STEPS To be followed for CI/CD:** ( for development purpose - testing env)

1) Need to add jenkinsFile in Dev repo - which is to build dev code and trigger QA automation

<pre lang="groovy"><code>pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Build Dev') { steps { echo 'Build or test dev code here' } } stage('Trigger QA Automation') { steps { build job: 'QA-Repo' } } } } </code></pre>

  
2) JenkinsFile in QA repo has to be included to run and generate report

<pre lang="groovy"><code>pipeline { agent any tools { maven 'Maven 3.6.3' allure 'Allure' } stages { stage('Checkout') { steps { git url: '&lt;gitUrl&gt;', branch: '&lt;BranchName&gt;' } } stage('Build and Test') { steps { sh 'mvn clean test' } } stage('Generate Allure Report') { steps { sh 'mvn allure:report' } } } post { always { allure([ includeProperties: false, jdk: '', results: [[path: 'target/allure-results']] ]) } } }</code></pre>

3) Launch the Jenkins ( using jenkins command ) in Local , once launched , install all the plugins needed
4) Create 2 jobs as type pipeline for configuring Dev and QA repo
5) Configure the repo in their respective jobs and also make the configuration as necessary
6) In Dev repo Webhooks - Need to add payload url for triggering the Dev Job whenever dev commits the code
7) Since github can't access your local , run ngrok command to let public access for your local server

           ngrok http http://localhost:8080 
8) It will generate the url , use that as payload url along with repo name (eg : https://gitUserName:gitPassword@ngrokServerProvided/job/DevRepo/build )//Replace with your dev repo name
9) Now commit any changes in Dev repo . The build will be triggered in Dev jenkins job and on success,QA automation job will be run and generate Allure report at last
10) Now for every commit dev makes , the Dev build and QA automation will get triggered .

                                                        END
